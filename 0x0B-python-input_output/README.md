# 0x0B. Python - Input/Output

## Description
The projects in this directory focus on file I/O operations in Python, including reading from and writing to files, working with JSON data, and handling exceptions.

## Files
- `0-read_file.py`: Function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout.
- `1-number_of_lines.py`: Function that returns the number of lines in a text file.
- `2-read_lines.py`: Function that reads `n` lines of a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout.
- `3-write_file.py`: Function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written.
- `4-append_write.py`: Function that appends a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters added.
- `5-to_json_string.py`: Function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).
- `6-from_json_string.py`: Function that returns an object represented by a JSON string.
- `7-save_to_json_file.py`: Function that writes an object to a text file, using a JSON representation.
- `8-load_from_json_file.py`: Function that creates an object from a JSON file.
- `9-add_item.py`: Script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then saves them to a file using JSON representation.
- `10-class_to_json.py`: Function that returns the dictionary description of a simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer, boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.
- `11-student.py`: Class `Student` that defines a student with public instance attributes `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`.
- `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Function `pascal_triangle(n)` that generates Pascal's triangle with `n` rows.
- `100-append_after.py`: Function `append_after(filename, search_string, new_string)` that inserts a line of text to a file after each line containing a specific string.
- `101-stats.py`: Script that reads stdin line by line and computes metrics based on a specific log format.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.4.3)
- Code is formatted using `PEP 8` style guidelines.
