## Project Structure
* Each Python script contains a class or classes with specific attributes and methods as per the project requirements.
* The files are organized as follows:
  * 0-rectangle.py
  * 1-rectangle.py
  * 2-rectangle.py
  * 3-rectangle.py
  * 4-rectangle.py
  * 5-rectangle.py
  * 6-rectangle.py
  * 7-rectangle.py
  * 8-rectangle.py
  * 9-rectangle.py
  * 101-nqueens.py

## How to Use
* Each Python script can be executed directly in a Python environment.
* For example, to run `0-rectangle.py`, you can use the command:
```
./0-rectangle.py
```

Replace `0-rectangle.py` with the name of any other script you want to run.

## Requirements
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Python 3.8.5
* Pycodestyle 2.8.* (for code style compliance)
