# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This repository contains the solutions to the tasks in the "0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples" project. The project focuses on working with Python data structures, particularly lists and tuples. It involves implementing various functions that manipulate and analyze lists and tuples.

## Requirements

The project is implemented using Python programming language and assumes that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

## Files

The project includes the following files:

- `0-print_list_integer.py`: A Python function that prints all integers in a list.
- `1-element_at.py`: A Python function that retrieves an element from a list at a specific index.
- `2-replace_in_list.py`: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific index.
- `3-print_reversed_list_integer.py`: A Python function that prints all integers of a list in reverse order.
- `4-new_in_list.py`: A Python function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.
- `5-no_c.py`: A Python function that removes all occurrences of characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.
- `6-print_matrix_integer.py`: A Python function that prints a matrix of integers.
- `7-add_tuple.py`: A Python function that adds two tuples element-wise.
- `8-multiple_returns.py`: A Python function that returns the length of a string and its first character.
- `9-max_integer.py`: A Python function that finds the maximum integer in a list.
- `10-divisible_by_2.py`: A Python function that creates a new list of True/False values indicating whether integers are divisible by 2.
- `11-delete_at.py`: A Python function that deletes an element at a specific index in a list.
- `12-switch.py`: A Python script that demonstrates swapping values of variables using CPython.
- `13-is_palindrome.c`: A C function that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
- `lists.h`: Header file for C functions.
- `100-print_python_list_info.c`: A C function that prints basic info about Python lists.

## Usage

Each Python file contains a specific function or script that can be used independently. To use a particular function, you can import it in your Python script and call it as needed. For the C functions, you can compile the code and use it as demonstrated in the provided examples.

## Project Directory

The project is organized as follows:

- Each task is implemented in a separate Python or C file.
- The `lists.h` header file contains definitions required for C functions.
- The `100-test_lists.py` Python script demonstrates the usage of the C function `print_python_list_info`.
