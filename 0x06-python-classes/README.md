#0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate concepts related to classes and objects in Python. Each script focuses on different aspects of object-oriented programming, showcasing how to define and use classes, create objects, define methods, and work with class attributes.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into various directories, each containing scripts that correspond to specific tasks or concepts. Here's an overview of the contents:

- `0-square.py`: Defines a basic `Square` class with a private instance attribute and a simple instantiation method.
- `1-square.py`: Extends the `Square` class to include validation for the size attribute during instantiation.
- `2-square.py`: Adds a setter method for the size attribute in the `Square` class and handles exceptions.
- `3-square.py`: Implements a method to compute the area of a `Square` instance.
- `4-square.py`: Adds a custom implementation of comparison operators for `Square` instances based on their areas.
- `5-square.py`: Enhances the `Square` class to include a method for printing the square pattern using `#`.
- `6-square.py`: Adds a position attribute to the `Square` class and modifies the printing method to consider the position.
- `100-singly_linked_list.py`: Defines a `Node` class and a `SinglyLinkedList` class to demonstrate a simple singly linked list.
- `101-square.py`: Extends the `Square` class to support the use of comparison operators based on the square area.
- `102-square.py`: Implements a `MagicClass` class that mimics the behavior of a provided Python bytecode.
- `103-magic_class.py`: Contains the `MagicClass` class implementation as described by the provided bytecode.

## Getting Started
To explore the scripts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/udeme-goc/alx-higher_level_programming.git

2. Navigate to the relevant directory:
cd 0x06-python-classes

3. Run the Python scripts using the Python interpreter. For example:
python3 0-square.py
