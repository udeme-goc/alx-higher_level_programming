# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Project Description

This project explores the concept of object-oriented programming in Python and how everything in Python is treated as an object. It covers various aspects of object behavior, identity, and equality in Python.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into directories, each containing Python scripts and answer files for specific tasks related to object-oriented programming in Python.

- **0x09-python-everything_is_object:** This directory contains the main project files and subdirectories for each task.

## Task List
